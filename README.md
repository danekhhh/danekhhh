### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**danekhh**](https://github.com/danekhhh), a junior frontend developer based in Russia.


I like to gain new knowledge in order to create beautiful and useful applications. My goal is a full stack developer.
Outside of work and basic studies, I am interested in expanding my knowledge in the world of technology. I also create my own projects (most of them are in private repositories).

#### Fun Facts:
- I like a lot of different types of coffee and tea.
- Lupin is my favorite TV series.
- I've never written code on a Mac.
